## Student Management System
### Introduction
This is a console-based student management system. It can be used for students to manage their courses. There will be three main user roles in the application: Admin, Student, and Professor.

In the student management system, 

- A student can log in to their account, view/add/drop courses, check their course schedule, and view grades.

- A professor can view course information they have, and view the student lists for these courses.

- An admin can view course/student/professor lists, and add/delete courses/students/professors.
There will also be three files containing student/professor/admin information.

The student management system will read and parse all of the files. Once all information has been loaded into the system, youâ€™ll be able to log in as a(n) student/professor/administrator to test the system.
